//JavaScript While Loop
//The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
let i = 0, len = cars.length, text = "";

while ( i < len ) {
  
  console. log(cars[i]);

  i++;
}


//while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted.
