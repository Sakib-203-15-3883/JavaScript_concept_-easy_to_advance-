"use strict" 
//The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

//Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
//Names must begin with a letter.
//Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
//Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
//Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.



// Using var keyword.  If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.



// here var is a keyword which indicate variable & 
//firstName is a variable name &
// "sakib" is a string type data or information  which store in variable 
var firstName="sakib";// the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.


// use of a variable
// variable name case sensetive
console. log(firstName);
// change variable
firstName="mukit";
console. log(firstName);

// You can use the variable before it is declared:
carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
